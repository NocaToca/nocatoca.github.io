# Hello!
I go by Noellva! This about me is short and sweet - you can check out my blog for the long rambly ones.<br><br>

# About Me!
I'm a hobbiest game dev currently employed in middleware, and I do lots of coding. I love low level systems (mostly graphics), embedded GPU programming, cats, writing, and tooling! <br><br>

IRL facts are that I'm 23, live in Virginia, and have an adorable --menace-- cat named Cinnamon! She's a calico and a third orange cat, of which she likes to exagerate. Look at her moments before disaster:<br><br>

I build things like:<br>
\- GPU bound simulations (GPU more like coolPU)<br>
\- Games! And game systems (always centered around foxes)<br>
\- Tooling (making workflows suck less is an art form)<br>
\- Worlds! Worldbuilding is one of my favorite hobbies!<br><br>

You can check out related projects and information about them on my projects page! Just don't judge my coding style ;-;<br><br>

# Fun Facts!
Some fun facts about me that really might not be apparent:<br>
\- I'm a furry! (gasp!)<br>
\- I love writing and have writen a few short stories<br>
\- I love smithing! Metallurgy is one of my random interests<br>
\- My favorite game is Super Mystery Dungeon (it's better than sky - fight me)<br>
