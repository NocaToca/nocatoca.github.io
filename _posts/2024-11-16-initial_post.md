# Welcome!
Before I get into anything, I must welcome you to my site! I'm glad your curosity lead you here and I do hope it pays off for you!

This post is meant to serve as an introducttion into my site and little world. It is lengthy and by no means needs to be read thoroughly. For those in a hurry, I have a TLDR here!

### TL;DR
I'm a software developer who loves to focus on the GPU side of things with a heart to share what I learn with the world! My inpsiration to make this website this comes from cat-like coding and that is what I want the **Tutorials** section of this site to portray. I am still pretty young and, while I am currently content with my job, I never really had a centralized place to portray my projects. That is what the **Projects** section is for. You can see everything completed there!

The **Blog** section is mostly for me, but I'd be thrilled to have others read it! I have never been good at figuring out what to post on social media and how, so I'm putting everything here. If you're ever interested in something I have done or am doing, you can filter specifically for that project and read it's journey (at least from when I started this website). I'm pretty open about what I do, so if you see me post about it on Bluesky, Reddit, Tumblr, or another social media, I probably have posts detailing it.

Thanks so much for visiting!! ^w^

### Anywho,
If you are interested to read everything and learn more about me, this whole post will be the best way to do it. I have a scattered brain and this post will definitely reflect that, but I did my best to categorize it and include everything you could possibly want to know about!

# Who Am I?
Well, you probably have a decent idea of who I am already from my social media. I'm a 22 year old furry who tends to just love crafting and building things, always involving furries in some way. A little less broadcasted fact about me is that this does not only take place through game design, but writing as well! I do a lot more than just game design and GPU programming - I tend to like to look silly in a bunch of different hats. One that I know tends to be less popular is politics, in where I tend to be involved locally! That being said, this is not a place I will platform political discussions, but it is something I am involved in.

Getting into the personal area, I live in the United States and reside in Virginia. I'm from NYC however and hold unpopular affection towards the city. I went to university in that area and so deeply miss being in school! I'm a HUGE cat lover and have one of my own who I love and hate dearly. Her name is Cinnamon! As I type this she is bundled into my lap, not of her own valition mind you. She was chewing on my mouse cord so I wrapped her in a blanket to temparily stop her from doing so. 

Other than game development and writing, I also love hiking and playing games. My all time favorite games include: Pokemon Super Mystery Dungeon and Explorers of Sky, Cyberpunk 2077, Stellaris, and Baldurs Gate 3! I do mostly play League of Legends, but am not so proud of it. I am forced to by my friends.

## Are You in Game Development Professionally?
*No.* Unless your path is clear and paved, I cannot recommend going into Game Development. You do not need professional game development experience to be a good game developer. I want to make sure others realize that!

My actual job is within distributed systems. I work on a product that acts a middleware for these systems. It is the farthest thing from Game Development but very enjoyable to me. It is a lot of coding and a lot of problem solving that can prove to be stressful! I usually come in when these distributed systems involve GPU systems and I have to deal with adequate transfer through whatever transports we wish to communicate data through - it might not even be in the same local system! This occurs in a lot of super-computers and systems that train AI, although I don't specifically do that.

Needless to say, it is the farthest thing from game development!

# What do I do?
As I have mentioned before, you'll see quite a lot of different feilds and projects throughout my blogsite. The easy answer to this question is that I tend to do whatever interests me the most at the time. This is frequently going to be something coding related. However, I do also write and world-build often! I love sharing what I do in that realm as well, but I am by no means experienced in those feilds. Outside of coding, take all of my advice with a grain of salt. Hell, even in coding take my advice with a grain of salt! I do tend to be wrong or sub-optimal, but such is the process of learning within a field.

## Projects
Speaking of the process of learning, I do this most by creating various projects. This can range to my own indulgement or something one of my friends has asked me to build. My current favorite project is going to be my GPU-based Barnes-Hut Simulation! I do projects like that to learn more about shaders and working with the GPU, which is one of my biggest interest. On the other hand, my most sophistated project at the moment is going to be Lionpaw, which is a distributed Discord Bot that manages roleplay servers. At the moment it is repurposed for a single server since I only give it to my friends (I don't have unlimited storage!) and all other servers have since gone offline. Regardless, you can read more about specific projects in the projects page.

Now, if you're not interested in coding (which I'd be surprised about!) my biggest project is going to be something I call Vascou. It's a sci-fi based world I am working on. I am developing a good amount of tools to aid with it, with one of them being a Galaxy Map creator. Development of this world is scattered and pretty well set from before I made this blog, but I will try to post about it pretty often! 

## But Tutorials?
A big thing I want to do is educate others and provide easy access to resources I felt like gave me trouble in my journey. When I complete a project I think I can make a good tutorial for, like the Barnes-Hut CUDA implementation, I will provide a step-by-step tutorial on how I achieved it in this section. Another thing I would want to provide tutorials on are basic introductions to GPU programming. I feel like it is always misinterpreted with technical art (I hardly do art or surface shaders - I do not have an artistic eye). The caveat to this is that I am still new to the field, so these tutorials will act more as guides. 

# Blogs!
Sometimes I might blog about my personal life. I like to be a transparent figure when I can and I really like when people who engage with me have an idea of who I am rather than some anonymous e-girl behind a screen. Most of the time, however, blogs are going to be project updates! If it details a new project that I have started to work on, it will be tagged as "New". Ideas are probably the most common and are tagged as such.

If you ever want to comment or talk to be about a blog post, feel free to DM me! I might add a commenting feature if enough people are interested and engaging.
