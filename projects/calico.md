# [Code](https://github.com/NocaToca/Calico)

# Overview
Calico was basically a project for me to get a simple understanding of Vulkan a better grasp of the Graphics Pipeline and how it works. I first create [this file](https://github.com/NocaToca/Vulkan-Test/blob/main/HelloTriangle.cpp) to ensure I understood and could render models before moving to compartmentalizing the code.
