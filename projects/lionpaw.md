# Overview
Lionpaw was a general-purpose roleplay management bot for Discord, built to streamline and centralize roleplay server administration. Designed with ease of use and performance in mind, Lionpaw removed the need for cluttered character submission channels, spreadsheets, and bot sprawl by bringing everything into Discord’s native interface. <br><br>

While Lionpaw is no longer actively maintained, it served as a powerful toolkit for roleplay communities. It supported on-server character tracking, document storage, and custom templates—all integrated directly into Discord through an intuitive command system.<br><br>

Key Features:<br>
\- Character Database: Quickly access, sort, and display character profiles using customizable templates. Perfect for lore-heavy servers with diverse cast lists.<br>
\- Modular Command System: Administrators could enable or disable specific features and commands without needing to touch the code.<br>
\- Parameter Parsing: Lionpaw parsed structured messages and automatically extracted data based on user-defined templates—great for enforcing formatting and keeping data organized. <br>
\- Thread-Safe Architecture: All database interactions were performed asynchronously and kept strictly local, minimizing overhead and API usage. <br>
\- Customizable Identity: Rename and rebrand the bot per-server, with support for changing display name and avatar from Discord commands. <br><br>

Built with a philosophy of data sovereignty and functional design, Lionpaw avoided remote dependencies, LLMs, and tracking. Its asynchronous architecture made it lightweight, performant, and ideal for self-hosting in smaller or privacy-conscious communities.<br><br>

While Lionpaw is no longer being updated or distributed publicly, I still have a fork I maintain for a friend's server. If you're curious, feel free to reach out!
