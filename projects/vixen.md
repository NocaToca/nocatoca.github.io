# Overview
Vixen is a game framework built in C# with MonoGame, focusing on high-performance async-friendly architecture. You can read about it in the blog! For that reason, this project description is the shortest. <br><br>

For employers, I'll happily share the git repo. Just ask! <br><br>

A lot of the challenges around Vixen revolve around making and managing systems myself. The project is much bigger than the simple games I'm used to, as the scope is substaintially bigger. I have delved into many aspects making the game, including narrative design and world building. I have also built systems I didn't think much about before, like animation systems which have made me greatly appreciate how not only Unity and Unreal Engine handle animations but even programs like Blender and Aesprite. <br><br>

Regardless, an overview of what I have implemented is as follows:
\- [AI Systems Using GOAP](\_posts\2025-05-10-week_in_review_7.md) <br>
\- [Collision Systems](Website\_posts\2025-05-03-week_in_review_6.md) <br>
\- [UI Systems](Website\_posts\2025-04-05-week_in_review_2.md) <br>
\- [Slight Camera System](Website\_posts\2025-04-19-week_in_review_4.md) <br><br>

I have also done a lot of design work!<br>
